/*Hello, and welcome to my basic character creator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.

This is meant to help with generating the 'modifiers' for resective ability scores. 

I could on for hours about the game, but all you need to know to make this operate is (mainly)
    to put in the character ability scores where you would like them (typically between 2-20, with 10 being seen as average)
    and choose your race (as character race does change the inital scores a bit). Then hit the Generate button at the bottom.
    The code will add the appropriate values and give the modifiers. I hope this helps when filling out a new character sheet.

NOTE: There is more to be done but the basics for the project, I believe have been hit.

Requirements:
1. Media queries do adjust certain elements depending on screen size. (lines 17 & 67 in CSS)
2. Custome written CSS elements are present.
3. JS file included
4. Comments are present
5. Over 5 commits have been done 
6. README is present 
7. Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout (CSS line 67)
8. Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button). (JS line 142)
9. Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site (JS file)
